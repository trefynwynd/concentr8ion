The name of the game is "Concentr8ion."

The purpose is to "search for your m8s" by finding matching pairs of them.

How to play:
1) Press the "Begin" button to show the board
2) Using your mouse, click on one of the cards.
3) Click on another card to see whether it matches.
4) If it does match, then you have found one of your m8s.
5) If it does not match, then the cards will flip back and you will have search out again.

Continue flipping cards until you find all of your m8s.


The following wireframe is what I thought would have been my version 1, but it will most likely be my end goal.
